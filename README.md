- **Data Loading**: Load and process text content from the provided URLs.
- **Text Splitting**: Split the text content into manageable chunks for processing.
- **Embeddings**: Generate embeddings using OpenAI's language model.
- **Vector Store**: Store and retrieve document embeddings using FAISS.
- **Search Functionality**: Perform searches on the processed data and get answers with sources.
